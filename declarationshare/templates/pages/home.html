                  Planning on taking over the world? Maybe you’ve decided to
                  be the first to climb Mount Everest while
                  wearing fuzzy pink bunny slippers? Are you a hopeless ice cream addict, an
                  expert hula hooper, or a rescuer of small turtles found floundering on the road?
                  Who are you? Who do you want to be? What will you do? Proclaim,
                  announce and declare it here -- the world wants to know!
